# LogRhythm SmartResponse Plug-In Editor (SRP-IDE)

Hi there,

This project, still in very early stage, is aimed at creating an authoring tool for LogRhythm SmartResponse plug-ins.

To have an idea of what my goal is, please look at the [PowerPoint](Design/20190312.SRP IDE - Visual Elements.pptx) and [Word](Design/20190312.SRP IDE - Specifications.docx) documents under the [/Design](Design/) folder.

Contact me if you would like to be involded.

Cheers,

 Tony
