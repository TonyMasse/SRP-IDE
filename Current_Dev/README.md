# LogRhythm SmartResponse Plug-In Editor (SRP-IDE)
## Current / Dev

Hi

What's here:

#### **SRP_IDE**
This is the VisualStudio project where the WPF interface is worked on in **MainWindow.xaml**.
The project is set to C#, but actually there is no code whatsoever that should put or used in there.
It's only to work on the XAML.

#### **SRP-Editor-vXXX.ps1**
The main PowerShell script

#### **UI Icons**
The export of all the icons used by this project. Both in SVG (master) and XAML (exported from the SVG).

#### **logs**
The logs created by the PowerShell script each times it run (one file per day)

Cheers,

 Tony
