# LogRhythm SmartResponse Plug-In Editor (SRP-IDE)
## Current / Dev

Hi

What's here:
1. **SRP_IDE**
2. **SRP-Editor-vXXX.ps1**
 - The main PowerShell script
3. **UI Icons**
 - The export of all the icons used by this project. Both in SVG (master) and XAML (exported from the SVG).
4. **logs**
 - The logs created by the PowerShell script each times it run (one file per day)

Cheers,

 Tony
